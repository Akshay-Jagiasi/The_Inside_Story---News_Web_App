# The_Inside_Story---News_Web_App

Through this project, I gained familiarity with React and had the opportunity to work with APIs. I implemented features such as a loading bar, infinite scroll, and a loading spinner to enhance the user experience. This project provided a valuable learning experience and allowed me to develop my skills in web development
